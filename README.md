# **TESTING NEEDED!!!**


Intro:

A long time ago,
in a galaxy far, far away..  
The E38 unit came into my hands after the EEPROM was damaged. The Seed/Key pair was irretrievably lost, the standard one did not fit...  after about a couple of days (or rather nights) of trying to recover the key, this script was born.



Features:
- 2 bytes Seed Key brutforce tester (via J2534 device).
- Power control - LLine (pin15). Use PowerBox or similar devce.

Script has 8 phases:
- **0** - Defaut Key
- **1** - Key = Seed
- **2** - All algo keys in "gmlan" proto
- **3** - All algo keys in "class2" proto
- **4** - All algo keys in "others" proto
- **5** - All keys with same hi-lo byte (0101, 0202 ...)
- **6** - All keys with mirror hi-lo byte (0110, 0220 ...)
- **7** - Bruteforce **all** 65536 keys

Script have settings:
- runForward - Key from 0000 to FFFF, or backward
- swapByte - Swap high and low Key Byte (0001, 0002 ... or 0100, 0200 ...)

and some more. Look inside.


Curren progress saves in "history\\%VIN%.last.ini" file.
